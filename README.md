No Data Collection: We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or browsing information. Everything runs locally in your browser.

No Tracking: The extension does not track your activity or behavior across Reddit or any other sites. There are no analytics, beacons, or external scripts.

No External Servers: All code is self-contained and does not connect to any third-party servers. It runs only on the tabs you choose to activate it in.

User-Initiated Only: All actions â€” including image detection and downloads â€” occur strictly when you click a button in the popup. The extension does not run passively in the background or interact with other sites.

Permissions Usage: The extension uses Chrome permissions (downloads, scripting, activeTab, host access to reddit.com domains) solely to enable its intended functionality. None of these permissions are used for data collection or remote communication.

If you have questions, feel free to reach out on github.
